gene: RPL27
  description: ribosomal protein L27 
  subunit: large sub-unit
  summary: Ribosomes, the organelles that catalyze protein synthesis, consist of a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit. Together these subunits are composed of four RNA species and approximately 80 structurally distinct proteins. This gene encodes a member of the L27e family of ribosomal proteins and a component of the 60S subunit. A splice site mutation in this gene has been identified in a Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) patient. As is typical for genes encoding ribosomal proteins, there are multiple processed pseudogenes of this gene dispersed through the genome. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2017]
